#Hello World! I’m Yitbarek-Wolde👋

I’m a passionate full-stack developer with a penchant for turning code into delightful experiences. 
Currently, I’m putting the finishing touches on my Masters in Software Development, and let me tell you, it’s been a wild ride! 🎓

#My Multilingual Toolbox 🛠️
JavaScript: My bread and butter. I can sling TypeScript, JavaScript, and even whisper sweet nothings in HTML5 and CSS3.
Python: My trusty sidekick. We’ve battled dragons (read: bugs) together and emerged victorious.
AI Enthusiast: When I’m not writing code, I’m probably daydreaming about neural networks and learning prompt engineering. 🤖
React & React Native: I’ve built pixel-perfect web and mobile apps.
Angular: I’ve tango with Angular too.
Node.js & Express: I’ve navigated the asynchronous seas and sailed through middleware like a seasoned sailor.
Databases: NoSQL mostly with MongoDB with Mongoose is just ✨, no much love for SQL these days but i know my way around—I’ve got databases covered like a warm blanket on a chilly night.
Learning Junkie: Curiosity is my compass. I devour tech blogs, tutorials, and documentation like a kid in a candy store.
Collaboration Ninja: let me at 'em! . 😂🙌
My Code Philosophy 🌟
“My code is poetry.” — probably 🤞 after refactoring my spaghetti code mulitple times 😂.

I believe in elegant solutions, clean code, and life’s too short for boring variable names, right? 😉
